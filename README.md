## Final Project: JavaScript Application Design Course

Welcome to the final project of our JavaScript Game Design course! In this project, we will be utilizing JavaScript along with P5.js and Node.js to create an exciting game experience. The core mechanics of our game involve detecting collisions between the player and various game objects, all while incorporating JavaScript's time functions to ensure smooth gameplay.

### Key Features:
- **P5.js Integration:** We'll leverage P5.js to create dynamic visual elements and efficiently handle graphics rendering.
- **Collision Detection:** Utilizing JavaScript, we'll implement robust collision detection algorithms to enhance gameplay realism.
- **Node.js Integration:** Node.js will be used for server-side functionalities, ensuring seamless multiplayer capabilities and data management.

### Screenshots:
Here are some screenshots showcasing different aspects of our game:

2. ![Gameplay](https://github.com/lennawy/Survive-Game/blob/main/gameplay.png) - Engaging gameplay featuring the player navigating through obstacles.
3. ![Victory](https://github.com/lennawy/Survive-Game/blob/main/victory.png) - The triumphant moment when the player achieves victory.
4. ![Defeat](https://github.com/lennawy/Survive-Game/blob/main/defeat.png) - A challenging scenario resulting in the player's defeat.

### Gameplay Mechanics:
- **Objective:** Navigate through the obstacles to reach the end goal.
- **Success Condition:** Complete the game without colliding with any obstacles.
- **Failure Condition:** Collide with any obstacles, resulting in a game over.

### Endings:
- **True End:** Achieve victory by successfully navigating through all obstacles.
- **Bad End:** Experience defeat by colliding with obstacles, resulting in a game over.

### Conclusion:
Our JavaScript game offers an immersive experience that challenges players to navigate through obstacles while showcasing the power and versatility of JavaScript, P5.js, and Node.js. Are you ready to embark on this thrilling journey?
