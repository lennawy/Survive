## Final Project: JavaScript Application Design Course

Welcome to the final project of our JavaScript Game Design course! In this project, we will be utilizing JavaScript along with P5.js and Node.js to create an exciting game experience. The core mechanics of our game involve detecting collisions between the player and various game objects, all while incorporating JavaScript's time functions to ensure smooth gameplay.

### Key Features:
- **P5.js Integration:** We'll leverage P5.js to create dynamic visual elements and efficiently handle graphics rendering.
- **Collision Detection:** Utilizing JavaScript, we'll implement robust collision detection algorithms to enhance gameplay realism.
- **Node.js Integration:** Node.js will be used for server-side functionalities, ensuring seamless multiplayer capabilities and data management.
